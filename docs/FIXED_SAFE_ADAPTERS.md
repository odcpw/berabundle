# Safe Adapters Fix Implementation

## Overview of Changes

We have refactored the Safe-related functionality in the application to fix issues with the execution flows for both EOA and Safe wallets. The primary error addressed was the "Failed to get Safes for owner: Request failed with status code 404" which was preventing the Safe transaction service from working properly.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive SafeAdapter

- Created a comprehensive `SafeAdapter` class in `/execution/adapters/safeAdapter.js` that properly handles all Safe Transaction Service interactions
- Implemented proper URL handling with fallbacks for different API formats
- Added robust error handling for 404 responses when looking up Safes by owner
- Implemented backward compatibility with both older and newer Safe SDK versions
- Added a fallback manual transaction preparation method for when Protocol Kit initialization fails

### 2. Improved SafeService Implementation

- Changed the `SafeService` class to use the new adapter pattern
- Removed direct Protocol Kit and API calls, delegating to the adapter instead
- Added proper error handling and meaningful error messages
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing method signatures

### 3. Fixed Connection Between Components

- Updated `berabundle.js` to properly initialize and connect all components
- Added proper references between components to ensure they can communicate
- Made sure SafeAdapter is properly shared between SafeService and TransactionService
- Eliminated redundant initialization and duplication of services

### 4. Removed Security Risk

- Eliminated code that attempted to extract private keys as plaintext
- Implemented proper signing workflows that never expose the private key

### 5. Added Format Conversion Support

- Added a utility method to convert between EOA and Safe transaction formats
- Implemented proper handling of different bundle formats

## Files Modified

1. `/execution/adapters/safeAdapter.js` - Created comprehensive adapter
2. `/execution/executors/safeExecutor.js` - Updated to use adapter pattern
3. `/execution/executors/eoaExecutor.js` - Updated to use shared SafeService
4. `/berabundle.js` - Improved initialization and component wiring

## Testing Results

All components are now properly connected and working together:

- SafeAdapter initialization is successful
- SafeService properly delegates to the adapter
- TransactionService correctly references the SafeService
- The getSafesByOwner method now properly handles 404 responses
- Safe transaction preparation works with both Protocol Kit and manual fallback
- Format conversion between EOA and Safe transactions works correctly

## Next Steps

The Safe adapter fixes are now complete. The application should now correctly handle:

1. Checking for Safes where an address is an owner
2. Proposing transactions to the Safe Transaction Service
3. Confirming existing Safe transactions 
4. Converting between EOA and Safe transaction formats

These changes make the Safe execution flow much more robust, even when APIs return errors or Protocol Kit initialization fails.
